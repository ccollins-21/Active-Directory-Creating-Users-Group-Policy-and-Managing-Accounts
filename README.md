# Active-Directory-Creating-Users-Group-Policy-and-Managing-Accounts
This is a continuation of the "Deploying Active Directory" project. Here we will set up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users, create a bunch of users using Powershell. Then we will configure group policy, deal with account lockouts, and observe logs.
